I want to perform some EDA on UBER rides in NYC 

I was able to get this data off of Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city

The Data I used: 

APR-SEP 2014 ride data for UBER 
  It contained:
  Date/Time : The date and time of the Uber pickup
  Lat : The latitude of the Uber pickup
  Lon : The longitude of the Uber pickup
  Base : The TLC base company code affiliated with the Uber pickup

Having just gone to NYC myself right after Christmas, the Data made sense: 

# FINDINGS:
- Rides steadly increased as the summer months neared. The earlier months had fewer rides.
- Also the 31st has about half the amount of rides for UBER which again makes sense since half the months don't have a 31st day. 
- Except for the the first hour in the morning, Rides seem to steadily increase for every hour in the day. 

LYFT Data: 
What was interesting about LYFT is that for one it was not as popular and the hours being utilized greatly differed from UBER. 

# Next Steps
I want to create a heatmap of all the longitudes and latitudes to map out where the rides where taking place. 

I hope people will find my EDA interesting!
